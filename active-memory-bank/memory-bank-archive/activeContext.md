# Active Context: MCP-Get Installation Plan

## 1. Current Focus
The current focus is on the initial planning and documentation phase of the MCP-Get installation. We are creating the necessary Memory Bank files before proceeding with the actual installation commands.

## 2. Immediate Next Steps
1.  Create `memory-bank/progress.md` to track the status of each installation step.
2.  Create `memory-bank/design.md` to outline the structure of the final documentation.
3.  Create `memory-bank/researchstack.md` to gather details about MCP-Get and the target packages.
4.  Present the full, detailed plan to the user for approval.
5.  Request the user to switch to **ACT MODE** to begin execution.

## 3. Key Decisions
- The installation will be performed step-by-step, with verification after each major action.
- The process will be documented in a final markdown file for the user's reference.
