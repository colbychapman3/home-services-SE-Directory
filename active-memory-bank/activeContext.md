# Active Context: Home Services SE Directory

## Current Work Focus
- **Primary Task**: Update and maintain the Memory Bank files for the Home Services SE Directory project to ensure accurate documentation and context for ongoing development.
- **Repository**: Working with the home-services-SE-Directory repo, specifically the refactor/comprehensive-improvements branch.
- **Key Activities**: 
  - Creating core Memory Bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md).
  - Planning to complete the activeContext.md and progress.md files next.
- **Tools Used**: Git for version control, VSCode for editing files, and the CLI for executing commands.

## Recent Changes and Learnings
- **Inspections**: Reviewed files like DetailsModal.jsx and serviceProvidersData.js, confirming dynamic data handling and user interface elements.
- **Learnings**: 
  - The codebase uses React with Vite and TailwindCSS, with no TypeScript, which simplifies setup but requires careful runtime checks.
  - Dependencies are managed via pnpm, and the node_modules changes indicate potential updates or cleanup during the refactor.
  - The DetailsModal component includes social links and a report feature, showing attention to user experience.

## Next Steps
- Complete the creation of progress.md to document the project's status and remaining tasks.
- Verify that the Memory Bank files align with the current state of the repository, especially after branch changes.
- Proceed with any further development or documentation based on user feedback.
- Consider updating the Memory Bank periodically to reflect changes in the project.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Branch Management**: Prioritizing the refactor branch for active development while keeping an eye on the master branch.
- **Tech Stack**: Sticking with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS for frontend development; no plans to introduce backend for now.
- **Documentation**: Ensuring that Memory Bank files are comprehensive and referenced during development to maintain consistency.

## Insights and Learnings
- The refactor branch has introduced significant UI improvements, such as enhanced modals and sorting features.
- Dependency management with pnpm and the observed node_modules changes suggest a need for regular dependency audits to avoid conflicts.
- The project's frontend-only nature simplifies deployment but requires robust client-side error handling, as seen in the DetailsModal's report feature.
