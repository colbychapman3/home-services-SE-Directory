# Progress: Home Services SE Directory

## What Works
- The Memory Bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md) have been successfully created and contain accurate documentation of the project's context.
- The repository structure and codebase have been inspected, and the Memory Bank files reflect the current state of the refactor/comprehensive-improvements branch.
- The project uses React 19, Vite 6.3.5, and TailwindCSS 4.1.7, with no TypeScript.
- Key components like DetailsModal and serviceProvidersData have been reviewed, confirming dynamic data handling and user interface elements.

## What's Left to Build
- **Documentation**: Complete the progress.md file and ensure all Memory Bank files are up-to-date.
- **Code Improvements**: 
  - The refactor branch has introduced UI improvements (e.g., enhanced modals, sorting features), but further refinements may be needed for consistency.
  - Consider adding backend integration for future scalability, though the current frontend-only approach simplifies deployment.
- **Testing and Validation**: 
  - Conduct thorough testing of new features, especially the report issue functionality and social media links.
  - Validate that all business data (serviceProvidersData.js) is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Dependency Management**: 
  - Perform a dependency audit to resolve any conflicts indicated by node_modules changes.
  - Ensure pnpm is configured correctly and consider switching to npm if issues arise.

## Next Steps
- **Complete Documentation**: Finalize progress.md and schedule periodic updates to the Memory Bank.
- **Feature Implementation**: 
  - Implement any outstanding features from the refactor branch.
  - Address any user feedback or reported issues.
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - Optimize state management for handling large datasets efficiently.
  - Ensure smooth interactions and fast loading times for a better user experience.
- **Deployment**: 
  - Set up static hosting for the frontend application.
  - Explore options for CI/CD if required.

## Timeline and Priorities
- **Short-term**: Complete documentation, test new features, and resolve dependencies.
- **Medium-term**: Implement backend integration if needed, and enhance performance.
- **Long-term**: Plan for scalability and future feature additions.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Outdated documentation causing confusion during development.
  - **Mitigation**: Update Memory Bank files regularly and involve the team in documentation.
- **Risk**: Dependency conflicts leading to build failures.
  - **Mitigation**: Perform regular dependency audits and use tools like `pnpm audit`.
- **Risk**: Inconsistent UI across components.
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce component reusability and design patterns through code reviews.

This document will be updated periodically to reflect the project's progress and any significant changes.
